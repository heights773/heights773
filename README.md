# More about me

An aspiring mobile iOS engineer, actively honing my skills and learning under the guidance of a mentor at my current company. Before diving into the tech world, I worked at Apple's flagship location here in Chicago, where my passion for innovative technology and user-friendly design began to take root.

Outside of work, you'll likely find me exploring Chicago's food scene, discovering new restaurants, or spending quality time with my dog, Jasper. Looking forward to connecting with others in the tech community and sharing ideas!
